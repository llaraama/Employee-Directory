An employee directory application that facilitates access to non-sensitive employee data through filters.This app breaks up the application's UI into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

Allow users to:
  * Sort the table by first name.

  * Filter the users by first name.
  
## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
